# archery-distribution-plotter
Plots data from the [MyTargets Archery](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.dreier.mytargets&hl=en_GB&gl=US) app

Initial and second version of a script which takes in a user-selected csv file and plots the values onto a target face, allowing the user to cleary 
and visually see the required changes to their archery setup.

Target based on a WA 60cm Compound target

See individual READMEs for more detailed documentation.

Plans to expand on this project for the CS50-P 2022 Final Project
- Let the user choose between CSV inputted data and a GUI which will let them plot their own arrows
- Select from common classification round types which will each have their own attributes (total arrows, target face)
- Select bow type (compound, recurve)
- Display the required scores for each rank
- --> This will need me to learn Tkinter better, maybe OpenCV for image coordinate selecting
